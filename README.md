# DamageModel

## Name
Build a simplified damage model to estimate the damage based on hazard/vulnerability/exposure data.

## Description
The repository has 3 main folder: 
>code: Contains a **python file** that generates the total damage and damage per asset given the inputs data.
A **Jupyter notebook** that breaks down the steps and shows results in every step.

>Inputs : Contains necessary inputs data:
- 
- shydromt_sfincs : 1.0.1

Necessary files for running the notebooks:
>paths.txt : This text file should be filled after setting up the Inputs folder. It contains variables/conditions that are used in the Notebooks. The file itself has some comments that should help filling it appropriately.

Annex notebooks: 
>Preprocessing.ipnyb: This notebooks contains codes and application examples on how to create the necessary input files.
>Calibration.ipnyb: This Notebook has an automated way of building/running calibration models for different scenarios

## Visuals
The flow chart in [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM4p0jxY=/) serves visualizing the workflow. It also has explanations for each file.

## Installation
The versions used in this workflow are:
- HydroMT version : 0.8.0
- shydromt_sfincs : 1.0.1


## Support
[SFINCS documentation](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_sfincs/latest/)

## Roadmap
Complete SFINCS workflow for compound flood modeling (Fluvial - Pluvial - Coastal) will be added shortly.
